## The vision

### Heart of One Nation

<img src="https://onenation.xyz/assets/img/onenation_heart.png" alt="Heart of One Nation" width="55px" align="right">

Governments fail to take care of Humans and Earth.  
We donâ€™t trust them.  
We donâ€™t respect them.â€©

Butâ€¦ what can we do?

Complains are boring.  
Protests are painful.  
Elections ? Fruitless.

**So... Why don't we start a nation?**
    
### Spirit of One Nation

One Nation is a **planetary wave** peacefully emancipating human beings from non-legitimate authorities.

Here, anger and fear give way to **creativity** and **courage**.

No need for new chiefs, nor for news laws and institutions.  
The Manifest warrants our **common quest for harmony**.
    
This text is the hyphen between all our differences.  
So that mutual trust makes us **act spontaneously in stigmergy**.
    
### Body of One Nation

First, One Nation vibrates in **each one of us**, every time a human being sign the Manifest with the heart and the soul.
    
Together, we form a **decentralised network** of human beings and oasis embracing the values of the Manifest
    
Every oasis, fixed or movable, is free to experiment its own organisation.
    
One Nation connects **open-source projects** that **build up alternatives to usual instruments of power** such as : identity, money, education, food, medias, ...
