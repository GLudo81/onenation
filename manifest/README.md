### Why a Manifest?

The manifest is the **corner stone** of One Nation.

It defines the **minimal set of values** shared amongst the human beings of One Nation and build an aura of trust between us.

Today, you may consider signing the manifest like a psycho-magic act, **a covenant with yourself and the Earth**. No external authority will ever check whether you live according to those terms or not.

Soon, One Nation will create a decentralized, unalterable ID registry: the Grand Papyrus. At that moment the manifest will hold the role of "term and conditions" before creating your new Avatar. 

### How to use it

- [Print](../medias/print/manifest_A4) or handwrite it on paper
- Write your **Avatar name** (it can be different from the one one your passport)
- Write **the date** (whatever the calendar)
- Add **your autograph** (fingerprint, photo, signature or anything that identifies yourself) 

Then you may:
- Keep it safe or display it
- Share it on social medias
- [Print](../medias/print/manifest_A4) it and glue it everywhere ! 

### Notice

**The french-speaking version is considered as the original**. The english speaking version needs a review from native english-speaking people before being the base for new translations.

Although One Nation is open source, **the original manifest can't be edited**. The first and last beings of One Nation should agree on the same terms.
